## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 12, part 1
This Lab was the most recent lab and our last lab was by far the one I enjoyed most. I liked the pixel aspect and the creation of them wasn't super complex yet still difficult for me to figure out. But once I did find out how to create them it was enjoyable. There was a rhythm to it again and using Magick and RGB wasn't too difficult. 

Lab 1, part 1
This is my second favorite because this was our first lab and how we started. It was first discovering the math problem and using the system to figure out how to solve it. It was stressful at first because we were beginning but we have come a long way since lab 1 and outputting a single equation.

Lab 6, part 2
This lab was also one of my favorites based on the concept of it being a card base themed. I love playing blackjack and other games with cards so this one felt special. I enjoyed the programming as well as it didn't feel as difficult and if I recall it was my first time using arguments in code. At first, it took a while for me to figure out how the code worked but I figured it out with the help of teachers of course.
